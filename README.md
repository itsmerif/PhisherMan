# PhisherMan
This repository contains a list of potential websites detected by my tool PhisherMan using regex and common patterns in the domain names. Some sites may also be false-positive. If any non-malicious sites are listed in this, kindly comment for removal.

The lists herein may also be used to create a blacklist for your organisation and/or your personal firewall, or a central DNS.

Splitting the files in chunks of files not more than 10MB each for easier download and processing!
All the files are in text. Use Notepad to view/edit. (Notepad++ is recommended though!)
